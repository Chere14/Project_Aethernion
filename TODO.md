## Observations and Improvements

- [ ] Camera at the edge of the terrain is increasing the distance between it and the character when keep goinig in the direction of the edge. 
- [ ] The character speed is incresing when moving in the diagonal direction (Pitagora's theorem). The speed should be the same in every direction, even when going in a combined movement (up + right).
